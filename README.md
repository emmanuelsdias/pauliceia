# Pauliceia 2.0 Refactor

This is a fork from Pauliceia 2.0's original [front-end project](https://github.com/pauliceia/pauliceia). It was created as a separate repository and intends to update its deprecated dependencies and improve its structure.

This work is part of my thesis in Computer Engineering at ITA (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica).
